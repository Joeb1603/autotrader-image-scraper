**Autotrader image scraper**

Pass some variables, such as vehicle name, vehicle brand, vehicle type (suv, convertable etc), vehicle age, price range etc. This tool then goes through outotrader and collects all the images that match these variables.
It will then run an ai model to filter out the images not of the outside of cars, and performs logic on these detection to filter out half images of cars or cars that are in the background.
